A woman, a program, some canal -- palindrome checker!  
Created in 2024 by anson.

`panama` may or may not refer to a country/canal in Central America,
but for all intents and purposes, it refers to this program, which
is a simple novelty program to see if `stdin` or the contents of a
file consists of palindromes.

Usage and options can be read by invoking `panama --help` at the
command line. This project is licensed under the MIT License, See
